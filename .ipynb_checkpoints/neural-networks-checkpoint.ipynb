    "### Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "From [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/practice/perceptron-limitations/?chapter=perceptrons):\n",
    "\n",
    "The **perceptron** algorithm **divides a vector space into two classes**. Colloquially speaking, for it to succeed on all points in training data, the **points must be completely separable**. This is known as **linear separability**, as we seek to find lines (or higher-dimensional equivalents) that correctly classify all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we use linear models is that they have many nice properties. For example, linear models are simple and have few parameters to learn, thus requiring less training data to learn reliably. Moreover, linear models are visually and intuitively appealing, providing intuition on understanding the structure of the decision boundaries. However, because they’re so simple, the perceptron algorithm has several limitations (see section Limitations of perceptron)."

In the case with no bias term (a hyperplane through the origin), each step changed the signed distance from a misclassified point to the boundary by $|x|^2$. Thus, outliers far from the hyperplane will cause very large changes, and the algorithm will accordingly take longer to converge."
